    <h3>
        The Historic Eureka Inn is a fantastic place to experience the oldest town in Tennessee - Jonesborough. The inn balances a healthy mix of modern comforts without losing the old-timey charms. We practiced this same balancing act when designing and building their new website. Only a few months since launching, there have been over 30k views with the averge time on the page being just under 2 minutes.
