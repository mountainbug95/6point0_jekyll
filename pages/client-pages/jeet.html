            Jeet is sleek, simple and to the point. I think they showcase the grid system semantically and intuitively. The use of SVG’s is nice.

    <h3>
        Jeet is a published, award-winning interactive API designed with simplicity in mind. We still build things the way machines read them - not the way we intuit them. Jeet allows you to express your page grid the same way a human would describe it. We had the pleasure of both designing and developing this marketing site. It included a completely (and beautiful) responsive design that featured an interactive API on desktop resolutions. This was nominated for countless awards on sites like Abduzeedo, CSS Design Awards, and CSS Winner but won two awards - Awwwards Site of the Day and Graphic Design USA’s Web Design Award.
